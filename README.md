For this project, I worked on creating a reinforcement learning model for a pirate intelligent agent that could navigate a maze to find treasure. I was given the base environment and structure of the game, including some of the supporting functions and framework code. I developed and trained the model itself, implementing the Q-learning process, adjusting hyperparameters, and troubleshooting errors to make the agent learn from experience and improve over time. Seeing the agent gradually learn to find the optimal path was a rewarding moment that showed how reinforcement learning can mimic real-world decision making.

This course deepened my understanding of how computer scientists think and problem solve. Computer scientists design systems that can process information, learn, and adapt, and this kind of work has a huge impact on everything from healthcare to gaming. I learned that approaching a problem as a computer scientist means breaking it down into smaller, logical steps, testing and refining solutions, and being open to iteration. I also gained a better appreciation for the ethical side of the field. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, we have to consider issues like fairness, bias, and data privacy. My responsibility is not only to make systems that work but to make systems that serve people responsibly and transparently.
